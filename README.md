# teaching_Athens
teaching materials including code and ppts from Argyris Stringaris' lectures about scientific evidence delivered to psychiatry trainees at Athens Uni, First Dept of Psychiatry.
It starts with Seminar 2 which is about sampling Occam's razor and considerations about prediction and false positives. 
I have failed to find a good way to upload the video, but will keep trying. 
Any feedback and suggestions very welcome.
